# SafeLinkPreview
Safe Link Preview or SLP, is a safe sandbox enviroment that allows to avoid a potential phishing, nsfw, jumpscare or a rickroll.

This an educational project with no real world value but I still plan to add new features to it.

Using it as simple as providing an url and waiting for a screenshot.

To make it work properly you need to have geckodriver set-up.
